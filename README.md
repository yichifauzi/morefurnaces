# MoreFurnaces
This is a super simple server-side mod that adds quicker furnaces using Polymer.  
Textures are taken from [IronFurnaces](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-furnaces).

# Installation
This is a Fabric mod targeting servers.  
While it will also work fine on clients, you probably want to use a true port like [this one](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-furnaces-fabric) instead.  
Make sure to enable [Polymer AutoHost](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/) on your servers.
